## Project Overview
### Purpose

This is a nice one, we can see under a bubble chart in a map, the top of starting location rides and ending location rides. Basically the start point is the same as the end point for most trips

In this visualization we can see that most of trips in NY are in a range of an hour, and their duration is less than 30 minutes. As the trip duration increase the less of trips registered.

This is the same analysis than the previpus one, but in this one we can see that (by gender) the mens are, at least, 70% of users that use a bike in a range of an hour.

This heatmap tell us that in a bussiness days (Mon-Fri) the most common hours that users use a bike is before-work and after-work. On weekends the usage of bikes remains constant during the day in a schedule of 10 a.m. to 06 p.m.

The second one, shows the detail of hours between gender, no so much difference in the schedules of each one, again usage increase before-work hours and after-work hours. Just a little darker for males at midnight on weekend.

This second heatmap tell us the difference of bikes usage between the customers (one-time) and the subsribers. Once Again we can see that males are the ones with the higher use of bikes along the week. And also, something curious is that the quantity of rides under the gender "unknown" increase in the one-time side, there is the leak of this information.

## Summary
The results just confirm what we expected as a behaviour of a city as New York. We could say that most users are office workers of Manhattan using the service before and after office hours. On weekends the usage is a little more stable, perhaps due to tourism and users moving around.

Perhaps the chart we could include are the average of usage minutes per star time, it's a little odd to see the increase in average minutes at the middle of the night.

Also we can see that the longest trips are by the unknown genders with and average of over 35 minutes. Could we consider they are the tourist.
